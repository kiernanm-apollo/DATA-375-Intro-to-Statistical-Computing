# DATA-375-Intro-to-Statistical-Computing
This class's curriculum began with an introduction to using R laungage, and how to implement it in statistics. As the class progressed, I learned more about the theory of statistics, and how I could apply it using R.\
\
Throughout this class I was able to synthesize previous statistical knowledge and gain an important understanding of how it can be used in a professional setting.
For my project, I chose to use my statistical and R knowledge to gauge the question of how existent a 'Home Team' advantage is in the NHL.
I attatched my R code in an RMD file as well as my final report about my findings.
